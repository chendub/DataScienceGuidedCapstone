Big Mountain Resort has recently added a new chair lift which will increase the operating cost by $1,540,000 this season. To offset the extra cost, management is considering adjusting ticket price and implement changes in their facilities and operation to cut costs. They would like to approach this problem by using state-wide ski resort market data to build machine learning model and make predictions that will  help them come up with an actionable plan and see a 5% increase in revenue in 2 months.

The Ski Resort Data originally had 27 feature columns and 330 unique entries that includes data for Big Mountain Resort. During the data cleaning process, one erroneous data entry for SkiableTerrain_ac was corrected. The fastEight column had around 50% of its values missing and all but one of the remaining values are zero so this column was dropped. Entry for Pine Knob Ski Resort was drop because of an error in its yearsOpen. All the rows that were missing both the AdultWeekend and AdultWeekday price data were also dropped. AdultWeeday has more missing values than AdulWeekend, so AdultWeekend was ultimately decided to be our target value and AdultWeekday column was dropped. In the end there were 25 columns and 277 rows of data used in building our model.

During exploratory data analysis, data on the ski resort market for each state in the US was gathered to help decipher the relationship between state and ticket price. Then, principle component analysis was performed. Looking at the distribution of the states and their average ticket price based on the first and second principle components which explained 77.2% of variance, there isn’t a very clear pattern between state and ticket price. Going forward, we might try dropping the state column altogether and build a price model that treats all the resort data in different state the same.

For the rest of the numeric features, a correlation heat map was generated. A few features seem to have reasonable correlation to our target feature, ‘AdultWeekend’. They include: ‘fastQuads’, ‘Runs’, ‘Snow Making_ac’, ’vertical_drop’, and ‘total_chairs’. Among the newly added state summary features, ‘resort_night_skiing_state_ratio’ has the best correlation with ticket price.

Similar observations were made when scatterplots were generated from plotting numeric features against ticket price. An interesting pattern was found in the resort_per_100kcapita feature, where when the value is low, there is high variability in price but as its value increases, price slowly climbs.
